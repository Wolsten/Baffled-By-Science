## Introduction

Matt Ridley recently wrote an article in _Spiked Online_ [Why global warming is good for us](https://www.spiked-online.com/2022/02/15/why-global-warming-is-good-for-us/) and made a number of points worth consideration.

## The world is getting greener

The data on this is very strong including a paper originally published by Nature. A NASA article on the paper [Carbon Dioxide Fertilization Greening Earth, Study Finds](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth) was particularly interesting. 

> From a quarter to half of Earthâ€™s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years largely due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, according to a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on April 25.

This article is based on a paper in nature published in 2016, unfortunately now unavailable. However, assuming an honest representation of the paper by NASA we can at least ask _Why isn't this fact covered in the main stream media?_ since it's difficult to understand how a greener world could be a bad thing?
