    <h1>Timeline charts</h1>

    <p>The timelines used in this blog fall into two types, which may be combined on one chart.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Data series shown as line graphs</li>
        <li>Event histories shown as waterfall diagrams</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When displayed in a blog post, individual events or series are associated with a category and may be highlighted by clicking the name in the Legend below the timeline. Clicking on an event will bring up a window providing more details about that event.</p>

    <p>You can also click on points in a series to display the data for that series and source reference. Clicking on a point in the data series highlights the corresponding point in the the chart.</p>
        
    <p>If you want to explore a timeline in more detail click on the <strong>Analyse</strong> button in the top right hand corner of a timeline.</p>

    <p>When exploring a dataset more controls are provided allowing you to sort, search and group the data. You can also adjust the time period being displayed by double-clicking an event, selecting an event then clicking the <strong>Focus</strong> button or by adjusting the date sliders at the bottom of the chart. Click the <strong>Reset</strong> button to display the default date range.</p>
