# Introduction

This repository is a static website blog for those of us who get frustrated by what we read and hear in the media about science and technology and the way in which it is translated into policy by government. My background is in physics and Information Technology and now I am semi-retired I have more time to think about a broader range of subjects. I don't claim to be an expert on anything but I have the luxury of time to explore things that many people don't and so hope to provide new insights which may be useful.

Thanks to [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog) for his excellent article on using Svelte to build a static web site.
